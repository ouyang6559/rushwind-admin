//! Corpus guard for the auth-free split.
//!
//! The generator classifies every route binding via the auth-free table
//! (`proto::AUTH_FREE`, the deployment's auth-free set). This test pins
//! BOTH directions against the live corpus:
//!
//! * every whitelisted pair still exists as a route binding — a dropped
//!   proto method would silently widen the gated set (a parity break);
//! * nothing beyond the whitelist classifies public — a table typo would
//!   silently expose a protected endpoint (a security break);
//! * the public binding count matches, so `additional_bindings` of a
//!   whitelisted operation stay exempt with their primary binding.
